Loan management:
Designing a Loan Management Console App in Java requires careful consideration of various functionalities and how they interact with each other. Let's break down the Low-Level Design (LLD) for this system.

Requirements
User Management: Users can register, log in, and update their profiles.

Loan Application: Users can apply for a loan with relevant details.

Loan Approval/Denial: Admin can approve or deny loan applications.

Loan Repayment: Users can view their loan status and repay loans.

Loan History: Users can view their past loans and repayment history.


### **3. Railway Ticket Booking Application**
1. **Classes**:
   - `Train`: Attributes: trainNumber (int), seatsAvailable (int), route (String). Methods: getAvailableSeats().
   - `Ticket`: Attributes: ticketId (int), trainNumber (int), passengerName (String). Methods: Constructor, getTicketDetails().
   - `Passenger`: Attributes: passengerId (int), name (String), age (int). Methods: getPassengerDetails().
